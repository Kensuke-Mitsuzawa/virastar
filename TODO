- do not put space after : in the context of numbers like hour 19:45 => ۱۹:۴۵
- spacing after , : ; causing a lot of problem in this case (,) => (, )
- do not destroy urls dots and colons

- translate to js


DONE:
- he yeh => hamzeh should consider arabic yeh and zwnj chars
- replacing quotes shouldn't be greedy 
- for suffixes also consider tari
- (IMP)  do not replace \n probably caused by fixing spaces after dots and commas
